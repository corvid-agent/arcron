# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code in this repo. See `AGENTS.md` and `README.md` for the
full picture. Keep all three consistent when conventions change.

## What this is

Arcron: Algorand smart contracts (Algorand Python / Puya + AlgoKit). The main
project is `smart_contracts/keeper/`, a permissionless keeper network, live on
TestNet (app 769891898; 769802474 and 769772891 are superseded, predating the
1.0 contract). `pulse/` is its demo target (app 769891902).

## Commands

- Everything: `fledge lanes run ci` (build + unit tests + spec check; must stay green)
- On a real chain: `fledge lanes run local` (ci + the keeper e2e; needs `algokit localnet start`)
- Endurance: `fledge lanes run endurance` (adds `scripts/keeper_soak.py`, ~3 min)
- Console: `cd web && bun run ng serve`; `bun test` for its unit tests
- Reading the live deployment (all read-only, none of them signs anything):
  `fledge run health` (upkeeps about to starve, upkeeps that pay a keeper
  nothing, keeper solvency), `fledge run clock` (how long the deployment has
  been the deployment, and it refuses to count once the local build stops
  matching the chain), `fledge run keeper-ui` (a local dashboard on 4300, never
  published).
- Fixing what `health` finds starving: `fledge run topup` prices every upkeep
  in **days of runway** and prints the top-ups that reach 30 of them. It signs
  nothing until `fledge run topup -- --send`. It deliberately refuses to fund
  an upkeep whose cadence makes 30 days cost more than 10 ALGO: upkeeps 98-109
  run every 20 rounds and would need 192 ALGO each, and the answer to those is
  `cancel`, not a top-up.
- Would running a keeper here be worth it: `fledge run keeper-preview`
  measures what the registry actually paid (the inner payment `execute`
  sends, less the group fee the keeper paid to send it), reports the split
  rather than only the total, and simulates the due upkeeps so a target
  that reverts is never counted as money on the table. Read-only. It exists
  so alpha task #93 can be decided before it is started.
- Console as a rendered page: `fledge run web-render` (needs `fledge run web-render-install` once)
- Console for hosting: `fledge run web-build-hosted` then `fledge run web-verify-hosted`; stage with `fledge run site-console -- --site <site checkout>`
- Build: `poetry run python -m smart_contracts build` (always rebuild after contract changes)
- Test: `poetry run pytest tests/ -q`
- Specs: `specsync check --strict`
- End-to-end: `poetry run python -m scripts.keeper_e2e --network localnet|testnet`
- Keeper bot: `poetry run python -m scripts.keeper_bot [--once] [--network N] [--app-id N]`
- Keeper race: `poetry run python -m scripts.keeper_race --network localnet` (two real bots, one due upkeep, aligned to the same barrier; exits non-zero if they did not actually collide)

## 1.0 scope (decided 2026-08-24)

Full reasoning in [`docs/design/1.0.md`](docs/design/1.0.md). The short version,
because these are easy to get wrong from memory:

- **A struct change means a new app id**, and every creator cancelling and
  re-registering by hand. That holds however a deployment is governed: an
  update replaces code, not the shape of boxes that already exist. (The
  contract *is* upgradeable until its creator calls `freeze`, which buys a
  bug fix, not a reshaped struct. See `docs/security.md`.) So #7, #14, #8 and
  #9 are batched into one release and the surface is then frozen.
- **#9 is an ASA fee *capability*, not a commitment.** CORVID is not wired in;
  escrow and fees stay ALGO by default. "No token required" remains true.
- **#15 (staking) and #22 (keeper-supplied data) are closed**, not merely
  deferred. Reasoning in [`docs/design/out-of-scope.md`](docs/design/out-of-scope.md).
  Staking has nothing to slash; keeper-supplied data inverts the one guarantee
  Arcron makes. The line between #8 and #22 is the reason: declaring which
  *resources* a call may touch is safe because the creator still fixes what is
  called, while letting a keeper supply *data* is a different product. Do not
  reopen either without reading that first.
- **Dogfood** is a recurring `rain` draw on TestNet, serviced by a keeper we
  run and watched by the notifier, with `pulse` as the heartbeat target for
  the uptime clock.
- **MainNet gate** (decided 2026-09-23, defined in `docs/releases.md`): create-
  permanent findings closed, three model reviewers each at 90+ with no open
  blocker, 30 days of the dogfood serviced on unchanged bytecode, and alpha
  tasks #92-94 answered (a fresh agent counts). No paid audit, no beta/rc
  clocks. Any contract change restarts the 30 days; a stall from an unfunded
  account does not. Created from `corvid.algo` and frozen promptly.
- **Public release** waits until the deployment is one we are not about to
  replace; the licence and docs (#50) land before visibility does.

## Rules

- Poetry venv, Python 3.13, never 3.14 (coincurve has no wheels).
- puyapy stays pinned `>=5.0,<5.10` to match algorand-python 3.5.x.
- Every contract has a strict spec-sync spec in `specs/<name>/`; update the
  spec's Public API tables, requirements, testing.md and Change Log whenever
  the contract surface changes.
- Tests use `algorand-python-testing` mocks: inner app calls are recorded, not
  executed, and minimum balances are not enforced (prove both in
  `scripts/keeper_e2e.py` on LocalNet); `UInt64()` takes plain `int` only.
- Scripts choose their network with `--network` / `ARCRON_NETWORK`
  (`scripts/network.py`); it loads `.env.<network>` and verifies the node's
  genesis id. LocalNet is dev mode: rounds only advance when you send
  transactions (`network.wait_for_round`).
- On TestNet: disable the suggested-params cache
  (`set_suggested_params_cache_timeout(0)`) and fund the app account's base
  MBR (0.1 ALGO) before it can escrow or hold boxes.
- Upkeep box values are ARC-4 head/tail encoded; `scripts/keeper_bot.py` has
  the reference decoder (`_decode_upkeep`), and `js/src/upkeep.ts`
  is its TypeScript twin; both are pinned to the same recorded box.
- `web/` is styled only with the CorvidLabs design system vendored in
  `web/public/brand/`: no hardcoded colours, no hand-rolled theme toggle.
- A CSS change to `web/` is not reviewed until `fledge run web-render` has run.
  Unit tests, four agent reviews and an axe-core pass at zero violations all
  missed a disabled Register button rendering at 1.02:1, because none of them
  ask a browser what colour anything ended up. That suite asserts properties of
  the rendered page (overflow, contrast on computed style in every control
  state, text size, touch targets, clipping, overlap) against a stubbed chain,
  and writes screenshots to `web/e2e/__screenshots__/`. What is knowingly
  unfixed lives in `web/e2e/baseline.json` with the reason; do not add to it to
  make a run pass.
- The console's canonical address is `https://corvidlabs.xyz/arcron/console/`,
  and it is a security property rather than a convenience: the contract is
  permissionless, so the address is the only thing separating our front end
  from a copy. Changing it means changing the base href in `fledge.toml`, the
  three constants at the top of `scripts/publish_console.py`, and every doc
  that names it.
- Wallets come from `@txnlab/use-wallet` (see `web/src/app/core/wallets.ts`),
  following the house pattern: Pera, Defly, Lute, Exodus and Kibisis need no
  configuration; only the generic WalletConnect entry takes a project id, and
  it is added only when one is set.
  Amounts display in ALGO; cadences display as time as well as rounds.
- `.env.*` files are gitignored and must stay that way. Never commit mnemonics;
  the TestNet deployer is a throwaway and must never be reused on mainnet.
